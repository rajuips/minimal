## Centrifugal Compressor Surge Model 

The surge lines are predicted based on the dynamic operational and climate change for the critical compressor at the site by saving 1M USD by reducing the unwanted trip due to surging. This was appreciated by management 


## Spare Analysis of Critical Rotating Machines

Carry out the detailed analysis based on SAP and identified the spares to be ordered and which need to be ordered , by doing this lead to effective utilization of client resources

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
